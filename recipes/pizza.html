    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      Your homemade pizza can be just as good (if not better) than anything you
      pick up.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pizza is a crowd-pleasing choice for busy weeknights and fun weekend
      dinners alike. But you don't have to rely on restaurants or takeout for
      top-notch pizza.
    </p>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>6 ounces low moisture mozzarella cheese, thinly sliced</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon dried oregano</li>
      <li>¼ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
      <li>½ cup no salt added canned crushed tomatoes</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil</li>
      <li>6 leaves fresh basil, torn</li>
      <li>3 cups bread flour</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon active dry yeast</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Make the dough: Pour warm water into a large bowl, then sprinkle yeast
        over the top. Let stand for 5 minutes. Stir in cold water and salt. Stir
        in flour, 1 cup at a time until incorporated.
      </li>
      <li>
        Knead dough on a floured surface until smooth, about 10 minutes. Divide
        in half and form into two tight dough balls. Coat with olive oil and
        refrigerate in a sealed container for at least 16 hours. Be sure to use
        a big enough container to allow dough to rise.
      </li>
      <li>
        Make the pizzas: Remove dough from the refrigerator one hour prior to
        using.
      </li>
      <li>
        Preheat the oven, with a pizza stone on the lowest rack, to 550 degrees
        F (288 degrees C). Lightly dust a pizza peel with flour.
      </li>
      <li>
        Prepare the first pizza: Lightly dust one dough ball with flour and
        stretch gradually until about 14 inches in diameter, or about the size
        of the pizza stone. Place on the floured peel.
      </li>
      <li>
        Slide the pizza onto the peel and remove from the oven; then slide off
        the peel onto a work surface. Sprinkle 1/2 of the basil leaves randomly
        over the pizza. Cut into wedges and serve.
      </li>
    </ol>
